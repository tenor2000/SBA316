# SBA316

Completed by Gregory Jung

## What is it about?

This project is a culmination of learning DOM and BOM manipulation with vanilla Javascript.

This is a landing page for a Cat AI company called 'KIT10 AI'. It deals with cat related AI products.

This website uses imports so this must be running on a live server.
